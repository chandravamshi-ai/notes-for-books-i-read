# Prompt Engineering - Chapter 6

## Overview

This notebook introduces the concept of **Prompt Engineering**—a method used to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT in generating the desired output. By carefully designing prompts, you can influence the behavior of the model, ensuring it produces more accurate, useful, or creative responses. The notebook walks through various strategies to create effective prompts for tasks such as text summarization, question answering, and data formatting.

## Key Concepts

1. **Role of the Prompt**: 
   - A well-constructed prompt tells the model what role it should assume (e.g., a teacher, a researcher), the task it needs to perform, and the format of the response.
   - Example: "You are an expert in summarizing academic papers. Please summarize the following text in bullet points."

2. **Prompt Structure**:
   - A typical prompt includes:
     - **Instruction**: The task you want the model to perform.
     - **Context**: Additional background information that the model needs.
     - **Data Format**: Specifying the format of the response (e.g., JSON, list, etc.).
     - **Audience and Tone**: Defining the intended audience (e.g., researchers) and the tone of the response (e.g., professional, conversational).

3. **Iterating Prompts**:
   - Experiment with different versions of a prompt to see how small changes affect the output. Adding or removing details can significantly influence the result.
   - Example: Including a tone instruction ("Provide a professional and clear response") may lead to more formal answers.

4. **Template-Based Prompting**:
   - You can use templates to maintain consistency across different prompts. These templates act as reusable structures where only the data changes, ensuring the model’s responses align with your needs every time.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - LLMs can generate structured outputs like JSON or tables. You can guide the model to produce outputs in a specific format by including clear instructions in the prompt.
   - Example: "Create a character profile in JSON format with the following details: name, attributes, skills, and background."

6. **Use Cases**:
   - **Summarization**: Ask the model to summarize large texts into digestible formats, such as bullet points or paragraphs.
   - **Data Extraction**: Extract key information from documents in a structured format like JSON.
   - **Role-Based Responses**: Instruct the model to adopt a specific persona (e.g., teacher, developer) and answer based on that perspective.

## How to Use

1. **Customize Prompts**: Adjust the tone, style, and format of your prompt based on your specific use case. For example, if you're working on summarizing research papers, you can ask the model to focus on extracting the key points.
   
2. **Experiment with Details**: Adding more information to your prompt (such as specifying the audience or desired tone) can help refine the model’s output.

3. **Test Multiple Versions**: Try different prompt versions to find what works best for your task. Small changes can lead to significant improvements in the model’s response.

4. **Use Structured Output**: If you need the model to generate responses in a specific format (e.g., JSON, tables), make sure to include this instruction in the prompt.

## Example

Here is a sample prompt for summarizing a research paper:
```text
You are an expert in Large Language Models. Summarize the key findings of the following research paper in bullet points, followed by a concise paragraph that explains the main results. The summary should help busy researchers quickly understand the newest trends.
```

## Conclusion

The art of prompt engineering lies in finding the balance between providing enough context for the model to understand the task and keeping the prompt concise. This notebook provides a foundation for mastering this skill by experimenting with different techniques and prompt structures.
