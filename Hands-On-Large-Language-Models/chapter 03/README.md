# Transformer-based Language Model Exploration

This notebook explores the inner workings of a transformer-based language model, focusing on token prediction, model output analysis, and generation optimization techniques.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Token Prediction
We examine how the model predicts the next token given a prompt:
- Input tokenization
- Model processing
- Language model head output
- Argmax operation for selecting the most probable token

### 2. Model Output Analysis
We analyze the shape and content of:
- Model output (hidden states): `torch.Size([1, 6, 3072])`
- Language model head output (logits): `torch.Size([1, 6, 32064])`

### 3. Text Generation
We implement and compare two text generation approaches:
- With caching: `use_cache=True`
- Without caching: `use_cache=False`

### 4. Caching in Transformer Architecture
We explore the caching mechanism in transformer models:
- Caching of Key (K) and Value (V) tensors
- Impact on generation speed
- Memory considerations

## Performance Comparison

Text generation performance with different caching settings:
- With cache: 6.66 s ± 2.22 s per loop
- Without cache: 21.9 s ± 94.6 ms per loop

Caching provides a significant speed improvement (approximately 3.3x faster) for text generation tasks.

## Key Takeaways

1. The model processes input tokens to produce hidden states, which are then converted to logits for token prediction.
2. Argmax operation on the last token's logits determines the next predicted token.
3. Caching K and V tensors in the transformer architecture significantly speeds up text generation.
4. The trade-off for faster generation with caching is increased memory usage.
