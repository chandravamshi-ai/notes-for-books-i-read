### What Are Tokens?
In the context of language models, a **token** is the smallest unit of text that the model processes. Tokens can be words, characters, or subwords, depending on how the tokenizer is designed. Tokenizing text breaks down a sentence or paragraph into these smaller, manageable chunks that a model can understand.

For example, the sentence "I love programming" might be broken into the following tokens:
- `"I"`
- `"love"`
- `"programming"`

In some cases, more complex tokenizers might even break down longer words into smaller subword tokens, such as splitting "programming" into "program" and "ming."

### What Are Token Embeddings?
A **token embedding** is a numeric representation of a token. Since machine learning models cannot directly interpret text, each token needs to be converted into a numerical format. This is where embeddings come into play.

An embedding is essentially a vector of numbers that represents a token in a continuous vector space. The idea is to encode each token in such a way that tokens with similar meanings have embeddings that are close to each other in this vector space. For example:
- The word `"king"` might have an embedding like `[0.27, -0.33, 0.12, ...]`
- The word `"queen"` might have an embedding like `[0.25, -0.31, 0.10, ...]`

The closer the embeddings of two tokens are, the more semantically similar they are.

### How Tokens and Embeddings Are Used in Language Models
Large language models (LLMs), such as the one used in this notebook (`microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`), rely heavily on tokenization and embeddings to process text data. Hereâ€™s a simplified view of how it works:
1. **Tokenization**: The input text is split into tokens by the tokenizer.
2. **Embedding Layer**: Each token is converted into a numeric embedding using a pre-trained embedding layer.
3. **Model Processing**: The model uses these embeddings to make sense of the text, performing tasks like generating text, answering questions, or understanding context.

### Tokenization in This Notebook
In this notebook, we use the `AutoTokenizer` class from the `transformers` library to tokenize text. The tokenizer splits the input text into tokens, which can then be fed into the model.

Example code from the notebook:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct", device_map="cuda", torch_dtype="auto")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct")

# Tokenize a sample sentence
text = "I love programming."
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```

### Embeddings in This Notebook
After tokenization, the model uses **token embeddings** to represent the tokens as vectors that it can process. The embeddings are crucial for transforming the input text into a form that the model can understand.

This notebook demonstrates how to use a pre-trained model that has already learned an embedding space. You don't need to create embeddings from scratch; instead, the model will generate them based on the input tokens.

### Why Tokens and Embeddings Matter
Tokens and embeddings are the backbone of how large language models work:
- **Tokens** are what the model sees as input.
- **Embeddings** are how the model interprets those tokens.

The quality of tokenization and embedding determines how well the model can understand and generate text. In this notebook, we explore these concepts to provide an understanding of how they fit into the architecture of large language models.

### Summary
This notebook focuses on:
1. **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into manageable tokens using a pre-trained tokenizer.
2. **Embeddings**: Converting tokens into numerical representations so that the model can process the text meaningfully.

These are fundamental steps in building and utilizing any language model.
- **Tokens**: The smallest units of text that the model processes.
- **Embeddings**: Numeric representations of these tokens, used by models to understand the meaning of the text.
- **Purpose in the Notebook**: The notebook walks through using a tokenizer to convert text into tokens and how the model processes these tokens into embeddings to understand and generate text.

This README section explains these key ideas simply while providing practical examples from the notebook for clarity.
